## 💬 Who Am I?

I'm a passionate full stack developer based in Bangalore who loves building meaningful digital experiences — from scalable backend APIs to clean and responsive frontends.

After starting my career in QA automation, I shifted my focus to full-stack development because I love being involved in both the **how** and the **why** behind products. Whether it’s integrating YouTube APIs, crafting Firebase notifications, or shaping beautiful React components — I’m always up for building something useful and impactful.
